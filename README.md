## Preparation

### X11 forwarding settings
You can refer to the [tutorial](https://blog.dengqi.org/posts/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-windows-%E8%87%AA%E5%B8%A6ssh%E7%9A%84x11%E8%BD%AC%E5%8F%91%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E5%B9%B6%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AEssh%E5%92%8Cvscode/). Steps 5 and following can be ignored

## Run the GUI
When using Windows local machine ssh connect to the remote server, it is better to set the path to the project folder first, i.e. user_name@server_name:~/work/Course/LLM4TabularTask

run
```python
python ./main_window.py
```
